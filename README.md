FAQ
How to run it?

Start it by running npm run start:dev
What's the 'history' field?

The history field is a list of the last 50 percentage changes.
Where do I get google auth credentials?

You can generate the credentials at google console.

For production environment - You'll need to place clientId in the configuration file config/app.js.

For development environment - create a file named .gauthrc in the root folder.

Place your clientId and apiKey in a json format -

{
"clientId": ""
}

I want to use Rollout-Dashboard without google auth, is it supported?

Currently this feature is not supported.

Add an issue on that and we'll refer that.
